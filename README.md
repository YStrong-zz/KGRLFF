# KGRLFF
The running environment for this experiment is python 3.6, Tensorflow and Keras. Hardware device is Nvidia RTX3090 GPU.

This experiment runs on RTX3090, which requires a specific version of Tensorflow, cuda and cudnn.

And some parts of Keras need to be modified to run. 

So, all these dependency files need to be installed offline, which can be downloaded from this link.
